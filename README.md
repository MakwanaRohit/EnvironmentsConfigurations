   - EnviromentSetup(Dev) -> for Run before it has default Debug in build configuration option, then change it to Debug(dev) follow all options(Test, Profile, Analyze, Archive) for dev and prod.

4. Create .xcconfig files (Dev/Prod)
5. Add necessary values in the key/value form
6. Then set xcconfig files as per related requirements to created configurations
   - Project navigator -> project -> info -> configurations

7. Then all keys need to be added to the info list as key/value
8. For predefined keys: add path for predefined keys like Bundle name or Bundle identifier, Then go to project -> target -> build setting -> packaging, select product bundle identifier add path for debug dev/ prod:
9. The output of this sample project: Shown these keys in the labels
